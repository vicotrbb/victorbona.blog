### Extended Analytics

- **EXT-01**: Top referring domains with actual domain names
- **EXT-02**: OS family breakdown (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
- **EXT-03**: Geographic distribution (requires GeoIP database)
- **EXT-04**: Real-time visitor count

### Dashboard Enhancements

- **DASH-EXT-01**: Alerting rules for traffic anomalies
- **DASH-EXT-02**: Comparison panels (this week vs last week)
- **DASH-EXT-03**: Export/report generation

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full referrer URLs | High cardinality risk, privacy concerns |
| Exact browser versions | High cardinality, family is sufficient |
| Individual visitor tracking | Privacy violation, Faro sessions sufficient |
| User session recording | Scope creep, not needed for analytics |
| Real-time dashboards | Polling sufficient for personal blog |
| Custom business metrics | Not relevant for blog analytics |
| Database storage | Blog must remain stateless |

## Traceability
