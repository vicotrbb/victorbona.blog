# How I Built Threadrize

Building [Threadrize](https://threadrize.com) has been quite the journey. What started as a simple tool to help me create better Twitter threads quickly evolved into a platform for content creators and X hackers.

## The Problem

Like many people building an audience on X, I faced a common set of challenges:

1. **Content Creation**: Writing engaging threads that follow platform best practices is time-consuming
2. **Consistency**: Maintaining a regular posting schedule while juggling other responsibilities
3. **Strategy**: Understanding what content actually resonates with my audience
4. **Growth**: Turning insights into actionable strategies to grow my following

I found myself without much success, none of the methods I used were producing results. There had to be a better way.

## The Tech Stack

I decided to build Threadrize using technologies that would provide both performance and flexibility, and at the same time, confortably for myself:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with the App Router
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- **Authentication/Database**: Supabase
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **AI**: OpenAI's ChatGPT for content generation and analysis
- **Analytics**: Custom-built metrics system using PostgreSQL and Chart.js

This stack gave me the perfect balance between developer experience, performance, and scalability.

## Building the Core Features

### Thread Generation & Transformation

The first feature I built was the thread transformer. The goal was to take any long-form content and automatically convert it into an engaging, properly formatted X thread.

The challenge wasn't just splitting text by character count â€“ it was maintaining narrative flow, identifying natural break points, and optimizing each segment for engagement.

I spent weeks fine-tuning the prompts for GPT-4o to ensure the transformed content maintained the author's voice while adding platform-native elements that perform well on X.

### Content Scheduling & Calendar

Next came the scheduling system. This wasn't just about posting at a specific time, it was about strategic content planning.

I built a visual calendar interface that allows users to:

- Schedule threads for optimal posting times
- Visualize their content pipeline
- Maintain posting consistency
- Analyze performance by time and day

The system uses a combination of user-specific data and platform-wide trends to suggest optimal posting times.

### Profile Analysis System

The profile analysis feature was perhaps the most complex to build. It pulls data from a user's X profile (with their permission) and runs it through several analysis algorithms and AIs:

1. **Engagement Analysis**: Which content types perform best
2. **Growth Patterns**: When follower growth accelerates or slows
3. **Audience Insights**: What resonates with their specific audience
4. **Competitive Benchmarking**: How they compare to similar accounts

Building this required working closely with X's API and implementing several data processing pipelines.

## Technical Challenges

Building Threadrize wasn't without its challenges:

### API Rate Limits

Working with X's API meant dealing with strict rate limits. I had to implement caching and queuing systems to ensure we didn't overwhelm the API while still providing timely data.

### Scaling AI Costs

AI-powered features are incredible but can get expensive quickly. I implemented a tiered credit system and optimized our prompts to reduce token usage without sacrificing quality.

## Lessons Learned

If I were to build Threadrize again, here's what I'd do differently:

1. **Start with a tighter MVP**: I probably built too many features before launching
2. **User testing earlier**: Getting real user feedback earlier would have helped prioritize features better
3. **More focus on analytics**: Users have consistently interacted more with analytics features

## What's Next

The future of Threadrize includes several exciting developments:

- **Advanced AI personalization**: Training on user-specific content styles
- **More features**: More and better features will be launched in the future.

## Try Threadrize

If you're trying to build an audience on X, you can try [Threadrize](https://threadrize.com) for free. The basic plan includes enough credits to transform and schedule several threads per month, and our paid plans offer almost unlimited access to all features.

I'd love to hear your feedback and continue improving the platform to meet the needs of content creators everywhere.
